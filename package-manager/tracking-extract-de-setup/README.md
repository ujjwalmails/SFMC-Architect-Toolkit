# Tracking Extract Data Extension Setup
This folder contains the standardized JSON package for Salesforce Marketing Cloud (SFMC) Tracking Extracts.

## Purpose
Creating tracking extract data extensions manually in SFMC is time-consuming. This package allows architects to instantly deploy a standardized set of Data Extensions including:
* Opens, Clicks, and Bounces
* Sent and NotSent logs
* Subscriber and SendJobImpression data

## How to Deploy
1. Download the `tracking-extract.json` file.
2. Log into your SFMC instance.
3. Navigate to **Package Manager**.
4. Upload this JSON to deploy all Data Extensions with the correct schemas and primary keys.
